    <h6>The idea</h6>
    <p>This page that you are watching, was made with the proppose to show my skills
        using Flask, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS.
        The images that are displayed, are generated with the neural network VQGAN+CLIP,
        by Katherine Crowson. A copy of such
        notebook in Colab, can be found <a
            href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1go6YwMFe5MX6XM9tv-cnQiSTU50N9EeT"
            target="_blank">here</a> Some effects, were extracted from different templates and addapted to this website.
    </p>
    <h6>Skills developed</h6>
    <p>I improve my intermediate skills in python, with the propose to deploy IA models
        online in order to impress my future
        recluters. Of course, I hope to do it with a dynamic website, instead of a
        static website, like the one that you are watching.
        My future blog, will be deployed using flask, because it is very symple and at
        some point scalable. And because, it is written in
        python, DeepLearning and MechineLearning applications could run natively.
