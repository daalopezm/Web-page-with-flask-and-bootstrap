    <h6>The idea</h6>
    <p>This project was an attempt to construct a gas simulator. The particles that conforms an
        ideal do not interact among each other. Otherwise, a real gas has interactions among its
        particles.
        A possible model could be the a Coulomb force that will be seen as a repulsion force.
        To address such propose, the equations of motion of each particle were obtained from the
        Coulomb force:
        \begin{equation}\label{force}
        F_i(\vec{r}_i(t))= \frac{q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{i < j}\frac{\hat{r}_i(t)}{|\vec{r}_i(t)-\vec{r}_j(t)|^2}
            \end{equation} The equation \ref{force} was used to find the velocity of each particle as: \begin{equation}
            \vec{v}_i(t)=\frac{1}{m_i}\frac{q^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\sum_{i < j}\int_0^{t} dt
            \frac{\hat{r}_i(t)}{|\vec{r}_i(t)-\vec{r}_j(t)|^2}+\vec{v}_i(0) \end{equation} where $m_i$ is the mass of
            each particle. $\vec{v}_i(0)$ is the initial condition of velocities. </p>

            <h6>How it works?</h6>
            <p>Yo must insert in the field the number of particles that you wanna render. Then,
                click "enter"</p>
            <figure>

            </figure>
            <p>In the dropdown menu, select the interaction and click in simulate. The fastest
                particle, more red it is and the darkest are slower than the red one.
            </p>

            <h6>Skills developed</h6>
            <p>In order to make the interface of the program, I used Tkinter, and Object
                Oriented Programming was used.
                Some basic knoledge of physics were used, like electrostatics and integration.
                The velocities are
                inserted into
                the object function move of Tkinter. This project reinforce my knowledge in
                basic Python.
